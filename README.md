## 🎯 What You'll Build

In this workshop, you will create a production-ready AI agent system with three user-friendly interfaces:

1. **Custom Chat UI** (http://localhost) - A beautiful chat interface for users.
2. **ADK Web Interface** (http://localhost/adk) - Access Google's powerful debugging tools.
3. **FastAPI Backend** (http://localhost:8000/docs) - Connect to the API for seamless integration.

### Three Working Examples of AI Agents:
- ✅ A single agent with custom tools.
- ✅ A sequential multi-agent workflow.
- ✅ Parallel execution with synthesis capabilities.
